Follow these step to get your labs onto GitHub:

1. Clone the repo into your lab
2. Create a branch with a fake name. DO NOT USE YOUR REAL NAME, AS THIS REPO IS PUBLIC!!!
3. Create folders according to the labs we have to complete
4. When you are done with a lab, copy the solution into the appropriate folder
5. Push the repo, including your branch into GitHub
6. Please don't forget the fake name you are using, since it has to be used to identify your work.
